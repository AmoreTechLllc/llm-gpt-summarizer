On Reddit, Mastodon users engaged in a discussion about several concerns related to the platform.

They sought improvements and optimizations to minimize the impact on their devices.

The Mastodon team acknowledged these concerns and assured users that they are actively working on reducing CPU usage. They emphasized their commitment to optimizing the platform to provide a smoother and more efficient experience for users.

Another point of discussion was content moderation. Users expressed the need for stronger moderation practices to ensure a safe and welcoming environment on the platform. They highlighted the importance of minimizing harmful and offensive content and the need for a robust reporting system.

The Mastodon team took these concerns seriously and assured users that they are prioritizing the development of enhanced content moderation tools. They aim to create a platform that fosters healthy conversations while taking appropriate action against problematic content.

Patreon's cookie practices also came under scrutiny, with users questioning the platform's data collection methods and privacy practices. Some users sought clarification on opting out of specific data collection features and expressed their desire for more transparency in Patreon's policies.

While Mastodon did not directly address the Patreon-specific concerns in their update, they assured users that they would work to resolve any account-related issues that may have arisen. They encouraged users to reach out to the support team for assistance and clarification, prioritizing user satisfaction and resolving any lingering doubts.
