I've noticed that Mastodon's advanced interface tends to use a lot of CPU and makes my fan kick into high gear. Hope they fix that soon!

- **User2**:
Content moderation has become crucial as Mastodon grows. I really hope they start paying their moderators fair wages if they expand their team.

- **User3**:
I keep seeing spam on Mastodon. It's becoming a real nuisance. Adding more moderators might help tackle this issue.

- **User4**:
Mastodon should address the issue of bot accounts. It would be great if they could label accounts that are operated by bots.

- **User5**:
A direct message option would be a useful addition to Mastodon. It would make it easier to have private conversations with other users.
