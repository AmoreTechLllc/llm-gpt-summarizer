# Mastodon Thanks Patrons for Support and Addresses User Concerns

*(Published: July 10, 2023)*

Mastodon, a popular open-source social media platform, recently released a Patreon update to express its gratitude towards its patrons for their support in developing a new type of social media experience[^1^]. However, while the update highlights the positive strides the platform has made, some users have reported issues with CPU usage on certain devices and requested updates on content moderation and spam concerns.

One of the main topics of discussion among users on Reddit has been a bug affecting the CPU usage of Mastodon, particularly in the Firefox browser on Mac. The bug has been present since 2021 but has yet to be resolved. Several users have voiced their frustrations and expressed hope for a fix in the near future[^2^].

Commenters on Reddit have also raised concerns about content moderation on Mastodon. They have requested updates on the platform's efforts to tackle spam and ensure a safe and enjoyable environment for users. While Mastodon has implemented measures to address these issues, some users are eager to hear about any recent developments[^3^].

Additionally, some users have expressed confusion about the platform, seeking further clarification on its features and functionality. In response, the community has provided helpful explanations and directed users to relevant resources for a better understanding of Mastodon[^4^].

Another suggestion that emerged from the comments was the addition of a direct message option on Mastodon. Some users believe that this feature would enhance communication among users and foster more meaningful connections on the platform[^5^].

Mastodon, which aims to provide an alternative to centralized social media platforms, has gained a substantial following over the years. Its commitment to building a diverse and user-centric community is evident. The platform appreciates the unwavering support of its patrons and promises to address issues such as CPU usage, content moderation, and spam concerns. Mastodon remains dedicated to improving its platform and ensuring a positive experience for all users[^1^].
