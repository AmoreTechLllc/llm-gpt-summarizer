Patreon, a popular crowdfunding platform, has recently expressed gratitude to its patrons for their unwavering support in building a groundbreaking form of social media. The company's latest update acknowledges the contributions of its patrons and emphasizes the positive impact they have had on the development of this exciting new platform. You can read the full update [here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/may-update-82941004).

Mastodon users have discussed various aspects of the platform, including CPU usage, potential bugs in the advanced web interface, content moderation, handling spam, and identifying bot accounts. These discussions provide valuable insights into users' experiences and their expectations for improvement.

One user on Mastodon mentioned that they noticed higher-than-expected CPU usage while using the advanced web interface. This comment highlights the importance of optimizing the platform's performance to ensure a smooth user experience.

Another user expressed concerns about potential bugs in the advanced web interface. Bugs can hinder navigation and functionality, so it's crucial for Patreon to address these issues promptly to maintain user satisfaction.

Content moderation is another topic raised by users. Some Mastodon users seek clarification on how Patreon plans to handle moderation and ensure a safe and respectful environment for its users. Establishing clear guidelines and implementing effective moderation practices is vital for the success of any social media platform.

Spam is an ongoing concern in the digital landscape, and some Mastodon users have queried how Patreon plans to combat it effectively. Building robust spam detection systems and implementing user-friendly reporting mechanisms can help ensure a more enjoyable experience for all users.

In addition to moderating content and combating spam, several comments also highlight the importance of labeling bot accounts accurately. Transparently identifying bot accounts will help users make informed decisions about who they engage with on the platform.

Furthermore, one user brought attention to a potential issue with Patreon's cookie consent form, suggesting that it could be deceptive. Addressing this concern and ensuring transparency in data usage and privacy measures will help build trust among users.

Lastly, some users expressed a desire for Patreon to consider adding a direct messaging feature to the Mastodon platform. This feature would enhance communication and facilitate private interactions between users.

As Patreon continues to evolve its new kind of social media, addressing these concerns and suggestions from users will be instrumental in creating a thriving and user-friendly platform. The company's commitment to transparency, performance optimization, effective content moderation, spam prevention, and user engagement will shape the future of this exciting project.
