Mastodon, the open-source social media platform, has recently faced criticism from users regarding its Advanced Web Interface. Reports suggest that the interface is causing high CPU usage and performance issues for some individuals. Additionally, there are concerns surrounding content moderation and the presence of spam on the platform.

In a recent [Patreon update](https://www.patreon.com/posts/may-update-82941004), Mastodon acknowledged the issue and expressed gratitude towards its patrons for supporting the development of their unique social media platform. However, some Reddit users have voiced their disappointment about the impact the Advanced Web Interface has had on their experience.

One user mentioned that the interface was consuming excessive CPU resources, leading to slower system performance. Others chimed in, expressing similar concerns and requesting optimizations to alleviate the strain on their devices.

Content moderation has also emerged as a prominent topic of discussion. Several Reddit users have raised concerns about the presence of spam accounts and the potential for false labeling of legitimate users as bot accounts. These issues have led to a call for stricter moderation measures to maintain a healthy and spam-free community environment.

Nevertheless, amidst the criticisms, some users have highlighted a positive aspect of Mastodon's web interface. They appreciate the functionality of direct messaging, which allows users to communicate more seamlessly, similar to an inbox-like experience. This feature has been widely suggested as a positive addition to the platform.

Mastodon has always been committed to improving the user experience and addressing concerns. The development team is actively working on resolving the performance issues associated with the Advanced Web Interface. They are also looking into the content moderation aspects and exploring ways to enhance spam detection and prevention.

As this discussion continues across various platforms, it is important to remember that Mastodon remains dedicated to its vision of providing a unique, user-centric social media experience. Through open-source collaboration and the support of its patrons, Mastodon aims to address the reported issues and create a better online community for its users.
