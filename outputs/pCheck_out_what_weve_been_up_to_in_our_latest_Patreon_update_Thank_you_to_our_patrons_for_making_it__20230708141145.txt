## Introduction

Patreon, a popular social media platform, has recently released a new update to enhance user experience and address some reported issues. However, users have raised concerns regarding CPU usage problems caused by Mastodon's Advanced Web Interface, as well as the unresponsiveness of browser tabs due to a bug in the interface. There have also been requests for improved content moderation on mastodon.social. Some users have had negative experiences with Patreon and are hesitant to support it. New users seek clarification on what content they can post and why NSFW (Not Safe for Work) content exists. Moreover, accounts being mislabeled as bot accounts have been reported. Lastly, there is a suggestion to add a direct message option like an inbox.

## CPU Usage Issues and Unresponsive Browser Tabs

New users have sought clarification on what they can post on Patreon's social media platform. They are particularly interested in understanding the presence of NSFW content. Addressing these concerns and clearly outlining the platform's guidelines regarding acceptable content would help new users navigate the platform more confidently.

## Accounts Mislabeled as Bot Accounts

Several reports suggest that certain accounts have been mislabeled as bot accounts. This misidentification can have significant implications for those affected, as it can lead to restricted access and limited engagement with other users. Patreon needs to enhance its algorithms and detection mechanisms to accurately identify and differentiate between genuine user accounts and bot accounts.

## Suggestion to Add a Direct Message Option

In order to facilitate more direct and private communication between users, there is a suggestion to add a direct message option, similar to an inbox. This would enable users to have one-on-one conversations and improve the overall user experience on Patreon's social media platform.

Requests for improved content moderation on mastodon.social have also been raised. Users' negative experiences with Patreon have led to concerns about its reliability. Clarification on allowable content and the existence of NSFW content is also necessary. Reports of mislabeled bot accounts highlight the need for improved account identification algorithms.
