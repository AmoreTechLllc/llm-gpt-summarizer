Mastodon recently released a Patreon update expressing gratitude to patrons for their support in developing a new type of social media platform. However, some users have reported issues with CPU usage, causing laptops to overheat. This problem is believed to be a bug in the advanced interface, particularly when the Federated Timeline is visible, resulting in excessive resource consumption. 

**[Comment]** A user on Mastodon mentioned, "I've experienced this issue myself. My laptop became extremely hot and slowed down significantly when using Mastodon. I'm glad they're aware of it and working to fix it."

As the update continues, Mastodon touches on the importance of content moderation and the fair wages for moderators, acknowledging these topics as ongoing challenges. While Mastodon strives to create a safe and inclusive environment, there are additional concerns raised by users. For instance, one user expressed frustration with Patreon's deceptive cookie form, while another user questioned the possibility of posting content freely on Mastodon.

**[Comment]** Another user commented, "I fully support initiatives that prioritize fair wages for moderators. It's crucial for maintaining a healthy online community. However, I do hope that Mastodon will also consider enabling more options for posting freely without restrictions."

Additional comments in the Mastodon thread discussed the labeling of mistaken bot accounts, the inclusion of NSFW (Not Safe for Work) content, and a suggestion to add a direct message option on the platform.

In conclusion, while Mastodon's Patreon update expressed gratitude to their supporters and acknowledged the ongoing challenges, it also touched on issues concerning CPU usage and content moderation. Users further contributed to the conversation by discussing topics such as Patreon's cookie form, posting restrictions, mistaken bot account labels, NSFW content, and the need for a direct message option.[0m
