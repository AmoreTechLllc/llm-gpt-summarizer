One common issue discussed was performance problems, including high CPU usage and the failure to unload cached media. **A user under the handle @TechGuru shared their frustration, stating, "The Advanced Web Interface is great, but it's causing my CPU to go into overdrive and cached media doesn't always unload properly.
